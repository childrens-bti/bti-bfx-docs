# Sprints

Sprints are arguably the most important part of Scrum. In the Rokita Lab, sprints are two week periods starting one after the other every other Tuesday. Sprints allow a set time for work to be planned, organized, and acomplished. Sprints enable predictability within an organiazation and provide a digestible amount of expected progress. It's helpful to think of sprints as small projects. See [the Scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#the-sprint) for more detail. On GitHub, sprints are called "iteration".
