# BTI Project Management

## Scrum

In the Rokita Lab, we are moving towards using Scrum as a project management framework. To get familiar with Scrum please refer to [the Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) or [Scrum Essentials in Under 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtQ3tpq-RuE).

## Sprint Planning

For an overview on sprints see [sprints](sprints.md). Sprint Planning along with Review and Retrospective happen bi-weekly on Tuesdays. Review and Retrospective begin at 11 am and Planning is at 1pm. For access to the meetings, please ask either Dr. Rokita or Alex Sickler.

## GitHub Project

Project management is done through GitHub. Issues can be created by anyone with access to a repository. They provide a way to track, plan, and discuss work. Issues can be created in each repo or in the [Internal Ticket Tracker](https://github.com/childrens-bti/internal-ticket-tracker). The Internal Ticket Tracker serves as a repository just for issues and contains issue templates for a number of common tasks that we work on and can be used for general tasks. Issues may be created in a repository for items related to that repository such as feature requests or bug reports. If you're unsure whether an issue should be created in a repo or the Internal Ticket Tracker, create the issue in the Ticket Tracker.

Issues are organized with information on the task being tracked, labels, type, assignees, and project. Within a project, issues can be given priority, size, iteration, and status.

The [BTI Bioinformatics Projects](https://github.com/orgs/childrens-bti/projects/1/views/1) serves as the main board and is used for tracking issue and PR statuses and team members workfloads. Issues and PRs can be added to the project. Periodically, all issues and PRs in the childrens-bti and the rokitalab organizations are added to this project. Issues and PRs may be assigned to multiple projects.
