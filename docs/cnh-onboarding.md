The administrative team within the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research (CCIR) has done a wonderful job creating a [CCIR-specific Sharepoint site](https://cnmc.sharepoint.com/sites/GRP_CCIRBearNecessities_CtrforCancerImmunologyRsch/SitePages/CCIR-Employee-Support-%26.aspx) for its faculty and staff.

## Training modules

As a staff member who will have access to large amounts of genomic data and potentially protected health information (PHI) for patients, we require everyone complete multiple general staff and specific biomedical research traing modules.

### CITI

If you do not have an account set up with CITI, please make one [here](https://www.citiprogram.org/). If your account has an old email associated, please update to use your Children's National email address and/or add your affiliation to `Children's National Medical Center` (CNMC). This way, other staff members can search for you and see whether you had completed certain trainings. Next, you should be able to see a number of courses for CNMC. Please complete the following:
