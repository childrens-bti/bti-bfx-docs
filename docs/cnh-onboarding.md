# CNH-specific onboarding

The Children's National Intranet (MS Sharepoint site) can be found [here](https://cnmc.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Homepage.aspx) and is relatively easy to navigate.
The administrative team within the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research (CCIR) has done a wonderful job creating a [CCIR-specific Sharepoint site](https://cnmc.sharepoint.com/sites/GRP_CCIRBearNecessities_CtrforCancerImmunologyRsch/SitePages/CCIR-Employee-Support-%26.aspx) for our team as well.

## Training modules

As a staff member who will have access to large amounts of genomic data and potentially protected health information (PHI) for patients, we require everyone complete multiple general staff and specific biomedical research traing modules.
